<!--Picture Scrambler Project - The aim is to create a small website with javascript functionality
that will allow a user to upload an image, split it into equal pieces, scramble it and allow the user 
arrange the image back to its original state 
TO DO:

1. Set up basic website structure 
    - Header section with title of site 
    - Div section with game instructions
    - Div section for the image with buttons for uploading and scrambling
2. Basic CSS styling
3. Javascript integration
    - Take an image, resize it to fit the div set aside for it
    - split the image into n parts 
    - mix those parts up (can I assign the image parts to an array and then randomise the indexes?)
    - Allow user input to rearrange the image (onclick events?)
